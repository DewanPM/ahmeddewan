              <h2>Experience</h2>
        <div style="text-align: justify;">
<p>In the field of microbiology, I have gained extensive experience in various culturing techniques, including the use of agar plates, 
broth cultures, and selective and differential media. My expertise extends to media preparation and performing serial dilutions, 
which are crucial for isolating and quantifying microorganisms. I am well-versed in sterilization processes and antimicrobial susceptibility testing,
ensuring accurate and reliable laboratory results. 
My work also involves sampling, isolation, staining, and identifying microorganisms with precision.Additionally, 
I have conducted tests to determine minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), 
which are vital for assessing antimicrobial effectiveness.My experience includes bacteriophage work, encompassing sampling, 
isolation, propagation, purification, and characterization, as well as investigating the antimicrobial effects 
of natural products extraction and engaging in food microbiology. </p>

<p>In the realm of molecular biology, I have honed my skills in DNA and RNA extraction, alongside gel electrophoresis techniques. 
I possess a solid understanding of gene expression, cloning, and purification processes, which are essential for various research applications. 
I am proficient in performing RT-PCR and qPCR, which are critical techniques in studying gene expression. My work also includes handling laboratory mice, 
where I gained practical experience in tube feeding and tissue dissection.</p>


<p>From a technological perspective, I am adept at utilizing various software and databases, including the NCBI database for primer design. 
My proficiency extends to applications like MS Office, Mendeley, and Overleaf for document preparation and reference management. 
I have experience with R language and Origin 8 for data analysis, as well as Canva and Biorender for creating visual content. 
Furthermore, I am familiar with gel analysis tools and SnapGene for molecular visualization and analysis.</p>

<p>In an industrial context, I have played a key role in developing Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) 
in alignment with the updated United States Pharmacopeia (USP) standards.My work in sterile industries includes conducting sterility tests, 
endotoxin tests, and water analysis,ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements. As an internal auditor, I have assessed production, quality assurance, 
and water station departments, leading total microbial count experiments for analyzing raw and finished products.
    I am committed to adhering to Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) and Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) standards while conducting environmental monitoring 
in production areas and microbiology labs. Additionally, I have been involved in validating process analyses of new products and training new employees, 
contributing to growth promotion and ensuring the quality of food analysis procedures.</p>

        <p><b>Master thesis summary</b></p>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
<div style="text-align: justify;">
    <p>My master's thesis focusing on Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), a prominent human pathogen with significant clinical implications. 
    It outlines the bacterium's characteristics, including its grape-like clusters and its capacity to cause a range of infections, 
     particularly concerning its increasing antibiotic resistance, notably in the form of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). 
    This resistance presents a major public health challenge, contributing to high morbidity and mortality rates globally, 
    which necessitates urgent action from health authorities.</p>
    
<p>The thesis elaborates on the adaptive mechanisms of S. aureus, particularly its ability to form biofilms that shield it from both 
the immune system and the effects of antibiotic treatments. Different strains of S. aureus exhibit varying resistance profiles influenced 
by their genetic makeup, with the mecA gene being a key factor for methicillin resistance, enabling survival despite antibiotic exposure.</p>

<p>In addressing the threat posed by S. aureus, the thesis proposes alternative therapeutic strategies, 
including phage therapy, which utilizes bacteriophages to specifically target and eliminate pathogenic bacteria. 
 Additionally, it explores the antimicrobial potential of plant extracts from traditional medicinal plants such as Nigella sativa (black cumin) 
and Lawsonia inermis (henna),assessing their efficacy in inhibiting S. aureus growth.</p>
<p>The research aims to achieve multiple objectives, including the isolation and identification of S. aureus from clinical samples, 
 the determination of virulence genes, antibiotic sensitivity testing, and evaluating the effects of plant extracts and bacteriophages 
 on S. aureus isolates. The thesis underscores the critical need for innovative approaches to combat antimicrobial resistance 
and highlights the importance of understanding the molecular characteristics of S. aureus in the development of effective treatment strategies.</p>
